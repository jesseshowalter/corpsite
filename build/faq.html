                <article class="post">
                  <h4>Can I send invites through text and email?</h4>
                  <p>Yes! You can choose the best way to invite each contact. Select any mobile number or email that you have saved in your address book to invite them to an event.</p>

                <article class="post">
                  <h4>Why are text invites not sent from my number?</h4>
                  <p>Guests added from the main add guests screen will get a text from Hobnob’s shortcode number (462 662). This allows guests to just reply to the text with “Yes” or “No” to RSVP and we keep track of all of the RSVPs for you. We can understand your concern that your guests may not recognize the number, which is why we make sure to include the host's name on the invite so your guests immediately know who it is from.</p>

                  <h4>What happens when a guest replies to the text or email invite?</h4>
                  <p>If a guest responds to the text they receive with an answer that is not an RSVP we forward that message to the host as a private message.</p>

                  <h4>Why don’t I see all my contacts on my Android phone?</h4>
                  <p>You may have a filter on your contacts. To turn off the filter:</p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>Go into your Contacts app and press the menu button in the top left</li>
                    <li>Press “Display Options”</li>
                    <li>Select the gmail account that your contacts are being synced with, and make sure all groups have check marks. That will turn off all filters.</li>
                  </ol>
                  <p>On Samsung devices it’s a little different:</p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>Go to: More > Settings > Contacts to Display</li>
                    <li>Your settings should be set to “All contacts”</li>
                    <li>Or use “Customized list” and turn on all the options to enable more contacts to be visible from within the app</li>
                  </ol>
