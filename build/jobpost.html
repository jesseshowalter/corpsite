      <h3>Senior Backend Engineer (Rails/Elixir)</h3>
      <div class="multiColumn">
        <p>We’re a small but experienced team focused on making it so easy and fun for people to get together in real life that they’re actually social again.</p>
        <p>We’ve designed an elegant and efficient way to round up the people you care about for the events and causes that are important to you – straight from your phone in under 60 seconds. Hobnob is changing the way people get together and there’s something very special about facilitating personal connections in a whole new – and beautiful - way.</p>
        <p>We’re looking for an extremely talented senior backend engineer with deep knowledge of Ruby/Rails, Elixir/Phoenix, and DevOps. The ideal candidate has a passion for (and experience with) crafting well-made, scalable APIs and for architecting the infrastructure that supports them.</p>
